Of course, more sophisticated representations exist, but this will be more than enough for now. \n",

But it turns out a lot of the concepts that apply in the familiar 2D and 3D spaces carry over to $n$ dimensions. Our decision boundary in 784-dimensional space is still linear, but rather than a line, it is a __hyperplane__. __Given our _ambient space (the space for our points, basically) is $d$ dimensions, a hyperplane in that space will always be $d-1$ dimensions.__ For example, 2D space will have a decision boundary in 1 dimension: a line. 1D space will have a DB in 0 dimensions: a single point. 3D space, 2D plane. In $n$-dimensional space, the concept still stays the same: the ambient space is being cut into two pieces by an $n-1$-dimensional hyperplane, where one side has predict IN CLASS, other side predict NOT IN CLASS.
