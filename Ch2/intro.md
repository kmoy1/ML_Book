Linear Classifiers
================================
In chapter 1, we got a overview of how linear classifiers worked with predicting credit risk. The model was represented by a __decision boundary__ that separate points in class (credit risk) from those that were not. We can visualize such a decision boundary as our red line below:

```{image} ../Ch1/pictures/defaultnew.png
:alt: Default Dataset

:align: center
```

We know that points on the right are predicted as credit risks ("in class") and left as non-risks ("not in class"). In this chapter, we'll take a deeper and more technical dive into understanding what this line exactly is.
